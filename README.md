# SwiftUIReactor

A little protocol which should help to strucuture your data flow in SwiftUI.

Heavily inspired by [@mecid](https://github.com/mecid)´s [blog](https://swiftwithmajid.com) and [@devxoul](https://github.com/devxoul)´s [ReactorKit](https://www.github.com/ReactorKit/ReactorKit).


## Usage



## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding SwiftUIReactor as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/julianpomper/SwiftUIReactor.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate it into your project manually.


## Requirements

* Swift 5.1
* iOS 13
